1.**Getting Started** *Match the pictures below to the circus entertainment below. Which of these types of entertainment do you like to watch? What do you like or dislike about circuses?*

**Juggling**

**Acrobatics**
They are fun to watch, but i'ts not the type of thing i like to see, it gives me some weird kind of anxiety.

**Clowning**
